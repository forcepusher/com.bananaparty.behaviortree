Unity package. Fully cross-platform Behavior Tree featuring support for deterministic simulation and prediction-rollback netcode.  
Does not reference Unity Engine, so it could be used in a regular C# project.  
  
Make sure you have standalone [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed first.  
In Unity, open "Window" -> "Package Manager".  
Click the "+" sign on top left corner -> "Add package from git URL..."  
Paste this: `https://github.com/forcepusher/com.bananaparty.behaviortree.git#1.2.1`  
See minimum required Unity version in the `package.json` file.
